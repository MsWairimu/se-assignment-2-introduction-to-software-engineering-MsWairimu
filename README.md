# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
- Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
The Software Development life cylce is in 6 phases, as mentioned below. 
1. Requirements phase
2. Design phase
3. Implementation Phase
4. Testing phase
5. Deployment phase
7. Maintenance phase

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
1. Requirements phase - Where user needs and system requirements are gathered.
2. Design phase -Creating a design of the software architecture that is to be created.
3. Implementation Phase - Writing the code and building the software according to the design specifications and the requirementents gathered. 
4. Testing phase - Having a number of tests to ensure that the software meets the standards and fucntional requirements.
5. Deployment phase - This is where the software is released to the users.
7. Maintenance phase - Providing ongoing support, updates and any enhancements to the software after in was deployed and already in use. 

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
- Agile methodology is an incremental approach that is focused on flexibility and collaboration, while Waterfall methodology offers a sequential approach with distinct phases that flow downwards like a waterfall.

Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? 
- Requirements engineering is the process of figuring out what a software system should do by talking to users and stakeholders to understand their needs and documenting these needs clearly. 
Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
- This process involves gathering, analyzing, and defining requirements before designing and building the software. It's important because it helps ensure the software meets users' expectations, reduces misunderstandings, and provides a clear guide for developers, which makes the entire development process smoother and more efficient.

Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
- Modularity in software design means breaking down a program into separate, independent parts called modules, each handling a specific task. This makes the software easier to understand, fix, and update because you can work on one module without affecting others. It also helps the software grow more easily since new features can be added as new modules without changing existing ones, allowing different teams to work on different parts at the same time.

Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
1. Unit testing checks individual parts or functions of the code to make sure each one works right.
2. Integration testing looks at how different parts of the code work together.
3. System testing tests the entire system to ensure everything works as a whole. 
4. Acceptance testing checks if the software meets users needs and requirements before it goes live. 
- Testing is crucial because it helps find and fix bugs early, ensuring the software is reliable, works as expected, and provides a good user experience.

Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
- These are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members.
- An example of a version control system is Git. Git is widely used for its distributed nature, meaning every developer has a complete copy of the repository, allowing for offline work and multiple collaboration workflows. It supports branching and merging, making it easy to work on different features simultaneously and integrate them later.

Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
- A software project manager is an individual who oversees the process and progress of a software project. They are responsible for giving guidance and order as to how the project is to be done and they are responsible of seeing it through to completion. Some of the challenges faced by software project managers is when there is lack of collaboration between team members regarding the project, it can be a challenge to manage such teams to a completion of a project.

Software Maintenance:
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
- oftware maintenance is the process of updating and improving software after it has been released to fix bugs, add new features, improve performance, or adapt it to new environments. 
- Different types of maintenance activities;
1.  Corrective - this is fising errors/bugs
2. Adaptive - modifying software to work in a new environment
3. Perfective - ehancing perfomance
4. Preventive - anticipating future problems and making changes to prevent them
- Maintenance is essential because it ensures that the software continues to meet users' needs, remains functional and efficient, and can adapt to changing requirements and technological advancements.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? 
1. Creating software that invades privacy.
2. Developing algorithms that are biased.
3. Working on projects that harm the society. 
How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
- To ensure that software engineers adhere to ethical standards, they can follow codes of ethics from professional organizations, for example, be transparent about their work, prioritize user safety and privacy, avoid conflicts of interest, and speak up if they see unethical practices. This helps them create software that is fair, responsible, and beneficial to all users.

Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
